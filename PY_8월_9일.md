## 단정문 (Assertation)
* 예: 
```py
assert double(1) == 2 
```
* pytest (pycharm에서는 이미 깔려있다): 
    * Expected Actual: 중간중간에 테스트하는 것이 좋다
    ```py
    pop install pytest
    ```
    * pytest: 틀린 부분을 알려줌

```py
def double(n):
    return n * 2

assert double(1) == 2
assert double(1234) == 2468
```

## TDD
1. First try
```py
def test_total():
    assert total([80]) == 80
```

2. Second try
```py
def total():
    pass

def test_total():
    assert total([80]) == 80
```

3. Third try
```py
def total(scores):
    pass

def test_total():
    assert total([80]) == 80
```

4. Fourth try
```py
def total(scores):
    return 80

def test_total():
    assert total([80]) == 80
```

5. Fifth try
```py
def total(scores):
    return scores[0]

def test_total():
    assert total([80]) == 80
```

6. Sixth try
```py
def total(scores):
    return scores[0]

def test_total():
    assert total([80]) == 80
    assert total([80, 100]) == 180
```
